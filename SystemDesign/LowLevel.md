## 6️⃣ Cloudinary Integration


This project uses **Cloudinary** for storing user and listing images. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Temporary Storage:**  
   Uploaded images are first stored temporarily in the `public/uploads` directory.

2. **Upload to Cloudinary:**  
   Images are then uploaded to Cloudinary using the Cloudinary SDK.

3. **Save URL in Database:**  
   After a successful upload, the **Cloudinary URL** of each image is saved in the corresponding MongoDB document:
   - User profile images → `User.profileImagePath`
   - Listing images → `Listing.listingPhotoPaths`

4. **Cleanup Local Files:**  
   Local files in `public/uploads` are deleted after a successful Cloudinary upload to save disk space.

**Benefits:**
- Offloads image storage from the server.
- Provides optimized delivery with URLs.
- Easily scalable and secure.

## 7️⃣ Flow Diagram (Description)
### User Flow – Registration, Listing, or Booking

A typical user flow for registration, listing, or booking follows this sequence:

1. **Frontend** sends an HTTP Request (POST/GET).  
2. **Express Routes** receives the request and calls the appropriate controller.  
3. **Controller / Route Logic** handles the business logic and performs CRUD operations.  
4. **MongoDB (Mongoose Models)** interacts with the database.  
5. **Cloudinary** is utilized for image uploads (if applicable).  
6. A **Response** is sent back to the Frontend.  
<img src="User_Flow.png" alt="Registration, Listing, or Booking user flow"
     style="width:480px; height:auto; display:block;">

## 8️⃣ Authentication Flow
1. A user sends a POST request to `/auth/register` with their profile information and an image.
2. The backend uploads the image to Cloudinary and saves the returned URL in the new `User` collection entry.
3. The user's password is an encrypted hash using `bcrypt`.
4. The new user document is saved in MongoDB.
5. Upon login, the backend verifies the user's password and generates a JWT, which is then sent back to the frontend for session management.
## 9️⃣Notifications (notification)
1.Send SMS booking confirmations using Twilio SMS API.
2.Triggered automatically when a new booking is created.
3.Configurable sender/receiver via environment variables.
## 🔟API Flow (with Notifications)
1.User makes a POST request → /bookings/create
2.Backend saves booking into MongoDB
3.After success, backend calls Notification Utility (utils/notification.js)
Twilio sends SMS → "🎉 Booking confirmed! Your stay is from {startDate} to {endDate}"

Response returned to frontend
## 1️⃣1️⃣ Notes for GitHub
1. A **User** can create many **Listings**.
2. A **User** (as a customer) can create many **Bookings**.
3. A **User** (as a host) can be associated with many **Bookings**.
4. A **Listing** can be part of many **Bookings**.
